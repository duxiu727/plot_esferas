 plot_esferas
==============

This is a short hack to use spheres as markers in matplotlib plot.
Main idea was borrowed/taken/(use your choice of words) from:
http://matplotlib.1069221.n5.nabble.com/custom-markers-from-images-tp4166p4173.html

I put this together for an easier use in a small function and added it as a method to matplotlib Axes, and I am sharing it in case somebody else finds it useful.

I am sure that there is many better ways to obtain the same result, and I'll be *really* very glad to learn about it.
